        <h2>Cyclone Information :</h2>
        <br>

        <h3>A cyclone is a weather phenomenon characterized by strong rotating winds around a low-pressure center, known as the eye. Cyclones can be classified into various types based on their location and intensity, 
          including tropical cyclones, extratropical cyclones, and subtropical cyclones. In general, cyclones are associated with heavy rainfall,
           thunderstorms, and strong winds, which can cause significant damage to coastal areas and inland regions. They are known by different names in
            various parts of the world, such as hurricanes in the Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean, typhoons in the western Pacific Ocean, and 
            cyclones in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific. Cyclones are fueled by warm ocean waters and atmospheric instability, making them most
             common in tropical and subtropical regions during certain times of the year. They are a natural part of the Earth's climate system but 
             can pose significant risks to human life, property, and infrastructure when they make landfall. Effective forecasting, early warning systems, 
             and disaster preparedness measures are essential for minimizing the impact of cyclones and protecting vulnerable communities from their 
             destructive forces.</h3>

                A hurricane is a type of tropical cyclone, which is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by low pressure, strong winds, and heavy rain. Hurricanes form over warm ocean waters near the equator and are typically accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning.</td>

            <tr>
              <td>How Do cyclones Occur?</td>
              <td>They originate from the interaction between warm ocean temperatures, moisture, and atmospheric instability. As warm air rises from the ocean's surface, it creates a low-pressure area that leads to the development of a spinning circulation pattern known as a tropical depression. As the system organizes and intensifies, it progresses into a tropical storm and eventually a hurricane when wind speeds reach or exceed 74 miles per hour (119 kilometers per hour). Hurricanes are characterized by their well-defined eye—an area of calm surrounded by the eyewall, where the strongest winds and heaviest rainfall occur. These storms can cause widespread devastation, including strong winds, heavy rainfall, storm surges, and flooding, making them one of the most formidable natural disasters. Understanding the factors that contribute to hurricane formation and development is essential for forecasting and mitigating their impacts on vulnerable communities.</td>
