            <h2>AWARENESS : </h2>
            <H3>
                Increasing public awareness about disaster preparedness is very important. The government can work with non-governmental organizations and community leaders to provide understanding and 
                training to the community to deal with disasters.Comprehensive disaster risk knowledge empowers communities to effectively prepare for, mitigate, 
                and respond to potential shocks and hazards. To help build this critical knowledge, the IFRC and 
                Save the Children have developed Public Awareness and Public Education (PAPE) key messages for disaster risk reduction.
                 By promoting evidence-based, clear, and consistent risk and safety messaging, 
                PAPE seeks to turn available human knowledge into specific action to reduce disaster risks. </H3>
